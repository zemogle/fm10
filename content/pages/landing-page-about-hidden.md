We are seeking input from the community in compiling a list of robotic telescopes for research and education.

<a href="/talks/" class="button is-link">Robotic Telescopes Survey</a>

### Summary

This Focus Meeting concentrates on the capacity and feasibility to build networks of
remote/robotic telescopes for educational use at undergraduate and high school level (last
years). Access to remote/robotic telescopes will contribute in building a critical mass of
astronomers, but most importantly, it will contribute to STEM education.

The ultimate goal is to enhance the scientific capacity of Global South countries. Performing
research-oriented, observation-based hands-on projects using remote/robotic telescopes
allows young students to maintain and raise their interest in STEM-oriented disciplines.
An inventory of the worldwide capacity of telescopes for such purpose, the content of the
project and a thorough discussion of the opportunities in offering network facilities to
universities in need, can mean an important step towards that higher mentioned goal.
